## 🧑‍💻 Folder Structure (GetX Pattern)

The project follows the **GetX Pattern** to keep the code clean, modular, and scalable. Below is the folder structure:

```
lib/
|-- app/
|   |-- data/              # Data layer (API, models)
|   |-- modules/           # App features (UI, controllers, bindings)
|       |-- home/          # Example feature module
|           |-- controllers/
|           |-- bindings/
|           |-- views/
|           |-- models/
|   |-- routes/            # App routes
|   |-- utils/             # Helper classes and utilities
|-- assets/                # Images, fonts, etc.
|-- main.dart              # Entry point
```

### Explanation:

- `app/data/` contains data models and API services.
- `app/modules/` contains features divided into smaller modules with **controllers**, **bindings**, **views**, and **models** for each feature.
- `app/routes/` handles navigation and routing.
- `app/utils/` contains utility functions like formatters or common reusable classes.
